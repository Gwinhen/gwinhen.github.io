I am an Assistant Professor in [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu) at [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu) and an [AI Safety Community Faculty](https://futureoflife.org/person/guanhong-tao/) at [Future of Life Institute](https://futureoflife.org/). My research focuses on the security and safety of AI-enabled systems, aiming to empower system providers and individual users to counteract attacks. I am broadly interested in a range of topics in security and privacy relating to machine learning, including <u>adversarial generative AI</u>, <u>security/privacy of LLM agents</u>, and <u>machine learning for security</u>. My projects are consistently published in conferences such as IEEE S&P / USENIX Security / CCS / NDSS, NeurIPS / ICML / ICLR / CVPR, and ICSE / FSE. I am a recipient of NVIDIA Academic Grant Award (2025), [Maurice H. Halstead Memorial Award](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/news/articles/2023/2023_purdue_cs_awards.html#:~:text=Head%20Randy%20Bond-,Maurice%20H.%20Halstead%20Memorial%20Award,-Professor%20Maurice%20H) (2023), and [ACM SIGPLAN Distinguished Paper Award](https://2019.splashcon.org/attending/splash-awards#oopsla-2019-distinguished-paper-awards) (2019).
I obtained my Ph.D. from Purdue University under the supervision of [Dr. Xiangyu Zhang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/xyzhang/). <!-- I received my bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University. -->
