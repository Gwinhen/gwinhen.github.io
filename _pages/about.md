I am an Assistant Professor in [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu) at [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu). My research focuses on the security and safety of AI-enabled systems, aiming to empower system providers and individual users to counteract attacks and biases. I am broadly interested in a range of topics in security and privacy relating to machine learning, including backdoor threats, adversarial generative AI, and machine learning for security. My projects are consistently published in conferences such as IEEE S&P / USENIX Security / CCS / NDSS, NeurIPS / ICML / ICLR / CVPR, and ICSE / FSE. I am a recipient of [Maurice H. Halstead Memorial Award](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/news/articles/2023/2023_purdue_cs_awards.html) (2023), [ECCV AROW Workshop Best Paper Award](https://eccv22-arow.github.io) (2022), and [ACM SIGPLAN Distinguished Paper Award](https://2019.splashcon.org/attending/splash-awards#oopsla-2019-distinguished-paper-awards) (2019).

I obtained my Ph.D. from Purdue University under the supervision of [Xiangyu Zhang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/xyzhang/). I received my bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University.

<b>I am looking for students interested in security and privacy at the intersection of machine learning and traditional systems. If you are interested in this research direction, please drop me an email with your CV and transcripts.</b>
